# devtools

The aim of devtools is to make your life as a package developer easy. 

It does this by providing tools to:

* simulate `R CMD install` during development  (IN PROGRESS)
* interactively run some parts of `R CMD check`
* build documentation, run tests and benchmarking your code
* help you release your package
