You will get the most out of usethis if you do some setup. To a certain extent, usethis can even help you with this task.

Key steps that accelerate your R development workflow (details on *how* to do all this follow):

  * Install Git and configure your `user.name` and `user.email`. If you use RStudio, make sure RStudio can find your Git executable.
  * Sign up for a free GitHub.com account. Make sure you can pull/push from your local computer to GitHub.com.
  * Get a personal access token from GitHub.com and store it as `GITHUB_PAT` in `.Renviron`.
  * Make usethis available in all your interactive R sessions and store your R package author info as usethis options in `.Rprofile`.
